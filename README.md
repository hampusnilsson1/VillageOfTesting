This project is a practical exploration of testing methodologies, aimed at providing hands-on experience in writing effective tests for software applications. 
The primary focus is on testing the functionality of the Village class, with an additional emphasis on testing the Save() and Load() functions in the VillageInput class. 

Note: The DatabaseConnection class is treated as if it were fully implemented, emphasizing the importance of creating robust and comprehensive tests even in the absence of a fully functional external component.
